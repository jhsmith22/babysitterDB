## Code File
babysitterDatabase_md.ipynb

The following csv files are read into the code to create the database: parent.csv, child.csv, babysitter.csv, job.csv, schedule.csv.

## Purpose
This project is a SQL database that could support a web application for babysitters to offer their services and parents to find babysitters that meet their needs. I populated fake data for the database. I did not create the web application for this project but that could be a future extension of this project. This is a course project for the University of Colorado Database Systems course (Summer 2022) within the computer science post-baccalaureate program. I demonstrate triggers and other constraints, complex queries, and indices.

The documentation for this project is embedded in the Jupyter Notebook markdown file: babysitterDatabase_md.ipynb. 

I also provide a a brief video describing the project here:
